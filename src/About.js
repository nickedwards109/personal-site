        <p>Hi! My name is Nick. I currently serve as a Technical Instructor at the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth College, which is where I attended undergraduate and graduate engineering school. I teach problem-solving, machine shop safety, and a broad range of technical skills ranging from introductory manual machining to CAD / CAM Programming / CNC machining. I also support student teams with guidance on diverse issues including fabrication, design for manufacturability, design and implementation of testing strategies, project management, and resolution of teamwork difficulties.</p>
        <p>I love puzzles. I love challenges. I love music. I love nature. I love people.</p>
        <p>I would love to hear from you! Drop me a line at nickedwards109@gmail.com anytime.</p>
