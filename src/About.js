        <p>I am a problem-solver, team enthusiast, general engineering technician, and aspiring teacher.</p>
        <p>I studied at the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth College, where I received my B.E. in Mechanical Engineering in 2011 and my Master of Engineering Management in 2012.</p>
        <p>During that time, I served extensively as a volunteer in a student-led non-profit organization called Dartmouth Humanitarian Engineering. Some of that experience involved working on the ground in Kenya on a clean water project, leading an assessment for a possible sanitation project in the Dominican Republic, optimizing the power output of a hydropower turbine design, and leading the organization as President for a year. I enjoyed working with people on technical projects and maximizing the impact of my colleagues' efforts through effective communication and leadership.</p>
        <p>I also did two internships (one as an Accounting Intern at a software company called BitTorrent, and one as an Analyst Intern at a small investment bank). My first job after Dartmouth was as an Analyst at an investment bank, but I quickly realized that the lifestyle of the finance industry did not suit me. I transitioned into a career as a precision machinist where I could leverage my technical education and develop my hands-on manufacturing skills.</p>
        <p>I worked as a CNC Mill Machinist in the automotive industry for half a year, and then worked as a Senior CNC Lathe Machinist and Programmer in the aerospace industry for almost 3 years. This experience significantly developed my machine shop skills and led me to deeper understanding of many challenges faced in precision manufacturing. It also provided me with a chance to train junior machinists, which was great practice for my aspiring career path as an engineering teacher.</p>
        <p>In early 2017, I left my position in the aerospace industry and spent the year focusing on software engineering through independent study as well as completion of the Back-End Software Engineering program at an excellent private school in Denver called Turing. My motivation for this is the increasing relevance of software in all engineering disciplines, as well as a desire to participate in the diverse, inclusive, supportive community at Turing. I have gained knowledge of modern software engineering practices like Object-Oriented Programming, Test-Driven Development, Version Control, and Database Design. I have also learned specific programming technologies like machine-to-machine communication with HTTP and WebSockets, database interaction with SQL, web server implementation with both Ruby on Rails and Node.js/Express.js, and front-end display with JavaScript/HTML/CSS. All of this was in a highly collaborative environment, providing experience in solving technical problems as part of a team. These skills will provide me with a solid base for educating students on modern software engineering practices and helping students work together to develop custom software when needed for unique applications.</p>
        <p>As for the present moment and the indefinite future, my preference would be to immediately start teaching and working with students full-time. I think that my broad experiences have provided me with a highly relevant set of technical skills, which will be highly valuable to students as they prepare for difficult engineering careers. I also think that as I continuously work to improve my teaching abilities, I will become an inspirational mentor who will enable students to reach their highest potential.</p>
