        <p>Hi! My name is Nick. I am an engineer, artist, teamwork enthusiast, and aspiring teacher.</p>
        <p>I studied at the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth College, where I graduated with a B.E. in Mechanical Engineering in 2011 and a Master of Engineering Management in 2012.</p>
        <p>During that time, I served extensively as a volunteer in a student-led non-profit organization called Dartmouth Humanitarian Engineering. Some of that experience involved working on the ground in Kenya on a clean water project, leading an assessment for a possible sanitation project in the Dominican Republic, optimizing the power output of a hydropower turbine design, and leading the organization as President for a year. I enjoyed working with people on technical projects and maximizing the impact of my colleagues' efforts through effective communication and leadership.</p>
        <p>I also did two internships (one as an Accounting Intern at a software company called BitTorrent, and one as an Analyst Intern at a small investment bank). My first job after Dartmouth was as an Analyst at an investment bank, but I quickly realized that the lifestyle of the finance industry did not suit me. I transitioned into a career as a precision machinist where I could leverage my technical education and develop my hands-on manufacturing skills.</p>
        <p>I worked as a CNC Mill Machinist in the automotive industry for half a year, and then worked as a Senior CNC Lathe Machinist and Programmer in the aerospace industry for almost 3 years. This experience significantly developed my machine shop skills, led me to deeper understanding of many challenges faced in precision manufacturing, and provided me with a chance to train junior machinists.</p>
        <p>In early 2017, I left my position in the aerospace industry and spent the year focusing on software engineering through independent study as well as completion of the Back-End Software Engineering program at an excellent private school in Denver called Turing. My motivation for this is the increasing relevance of software in all engineering disciplines, as well as a desire to participate in the diverse, inclusive, supportive community at Turing. I have gained knowledge of modern software engineering practices like Object-Oriented Programming, Test-Driven Development, Version Control, and Database Design. I have also learned specific programming technologies like machine-to-machine communication with HTTP and WebSockets, database interaction with SQL, web server implementation with both Ruby on Rails and Node.js/Express.js, and front-end display with JavaScript/HTML/CSS. This was all in a highly collaborative setting, providing deep experience in developing software in teams.</p>
        <p>Now, I have graduated from Turing and I am in a transitional time in my career. I aim to find a position where I can leverage my broad technical experience for the better of society and the environment. I think that serving as a teacher would enable me to be available as a motivator and technical resource for students, many of whom will go on to change the world for the better. I understand that I can influence the world by influencing people. The choice to be of service to others strikes me as the highest calling, and so I approach my budding career as a teacher with a sense of utmost respect for all of the individuals and institutions I work with. In service, onward we go.</p>
